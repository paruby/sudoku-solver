# Sudoku solver
Solves sudokus. 

Works by performing a depth-first search, filling in the blank values and terminating the branch when an inconsistency is found (duplicated numbers appearing in a row, column or 3x3 box).

sudoku.py is an implementation of this in Python, index.html is a Javascript implementation that you can actually use <a href="http://paulrubenstein.co.uk/sudoku-solver/">here</a>.
